# Changelog

All notable changes to open-tag are documented here.

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning: these tags track the **compute-plane daemon** npm package
(`@fancyboi999/open-tag-daemon`). The server and web app ship continuously
from `main`; see commit history for fine-grained server/web changes.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.13.1] — 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- **Windows missing-runtime admission**: resolve the real CLI through `cwd`, `PATH`, and
  `PATHEXT` before handing `.cmd` shims to `cross-spawn`. A missing runtime now emits
  ENOENT before any process-spawn admission, instead of briefly admitting the fallback
  `cmd.exe` process and losing the Turn when it exits.

## [0.13.0] — 2026-07-27

### Fixed

- **Queued Turn isolation**: each agent now executes durable Conversation Turns in strict FIFO
  order. A second DM or channel Turn stays invisible to the active runtime and does not create a
  zero-event Activity placeholder until the prior runtime turn reaches its terminal `online` state.
  Runtime `error` events no longer advance the queue early, and cold start admits only the queue
  head instead of exposing every pending Turn to one startup inbox check. A rejected admission
  barrier now creates neither runtime input nor a phantom Activity receipt.
- **Two-phase delivery admission**: daemon capability `delivery-admission-v2` adds a
  `ready -> admitted` barrier. The server verifies tenant, current machine, agent ownership, Turn,
  recipient, and sequence, durably writes recipient admission, then allows the daemon to notify the
  runtime. This closes the race where a fast `message check` saw an empty inbox and finished as
  Handled without replying. Completed delivery ids survive ordinary final-ACK loss and process
  replacement; NACK or pre-ACK disconnect releases the in-flight admission for retry.
- **Freshness cursor safety**: send-time stale-draft checks may surface unseen ambient collecting
  context without consuming its formal inbox observation. Direct/DM queued Turns do not hold the
  previous reply, and neither freshness nor a later stable message may advance `lastReadSeq` across
  an unadmitted Turn. Observation and per-draft review ledgers prevent repeated holds across gaps.
- **Consistent agent identity in chat**: DM sidebar, live Activity, persisted replies, threads, and
  action cards use the same display identity for generated avatar fallbacks.

### Changed

- Non-ambient `direct`, `dm`, and `assigned` Turn rows require recipient runtime admission before
  `message check`, decide, message send, or legacy thread reply. Ambient channel context remains
  readable so unmentioned agents can still judge relevance without being forced to answer.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-07-24

### Added

- **Sender-scoped Conversation Turns**: daemon delivery notices now carry a durable Turn id,
  coalesced message count, attention class, and deterministic delivery id. Separate humans or
  agents in one channel stay isolated, while short same-sender bursts arrive as one work notice.
- **Admission-aware delivery fencing**: the daemon de-duplicates a repeated Turn delivery id and ACKs
  only after explicit runtime admission. A resource-pressure queue stays pending until the runtime
  accepts the startup nudge; dequeue, stop, spawn, stdin, or `turn/start` failure sends a NACK and
  clears the fence so the same id can retry. Concurrent retries share one admission result, and an
  ACK/NACK without the durable delivery id is rejected rather than treated as compatible. Successful
  ids are persisted across daemon process replacement with a locked read-merge ledger that remains
  coherent while old and replacement daemon processes overlap, and the server records admission per
  recipient so a partial multi-recipient retry delivers only unresolved recipients. A busy runtime
  emits pending heartbeats that renew the transport waiter without producing an early final ACK.
- **Mixed-version fail-closed gate**: a daemon must advertise `delivery-admission-v1` before it can
  receive or pull a Conversation Turn. Missing-capability Turns stay active and paused, emit no
  start/delivery frames, and resume automatically when a capable bound daemon reconnects or the
  sole capable daemon takes responsibility for a legacy unbound agent.
- **Settled lifecycle control**: start, stop, reset, and restart now use the
  `agent-control-ack-v1` request/ACK contract. The server waits for the daemon operation to settle,
  returns reset failures instead of swallowing them, and never starts the next restart phase after
  a failed stop/reset. Start waits for initial runtime-protocol admission, stop/reset wait for the
  old process exit, and a late old exit cannot remove a replacement instance.

### Changed

- Per-agent Activity previews are FIFO: a second Turn waits for the first runtime turn to finish
  instead of prematurely closing its Activity and stealing subsequent trajectory events.
- Multi-mention recipients are capability-preflighted as one intent, then delivered concurrently
  under an attempt-fenced lease. A mixed-version fleet therefore starts none of the named agents
  instead of half the team. A partial runtime
  NACK keeps the Turn and explicit grants visible while deterministic same-id retries finish; stale
  dispatchers cannot overwrite a newer attempt or a reply that already completed.
- The standing prompt handles every distinct canonical trigger in one inbox check, while preserving
  one decision and at most one granted public result per agent and trigger.

## [0.11.0] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- **Conversation-scoped Agent Activity**: daemon status and trajectory frames now carry the active
  `channelId`, reply `streamId`, and monotonically increasing `runSeq`. The server uses that context
  to persist complete thinking/tool/status history under the public messages produced by the run,
  including correct segmentation when one run sends multiple messages.

### Changed

- Runtime narration is no longer mirrored into provisional `agent:reply delta` text. It is emitted
  only as Activity; a public message exists only when the agent calls the message API. Runs that post
  no message finish as a human-visible handled/error Activity receipt, which agent inbox/read APIs
  exclude to prevent collaboration loops.

## [0.10.4] — 2026-07-23

### Changed

- **Explicit multi-agent work mentions**: the standing prompt recognizes independent
  `directed` grants for every explicitly mentioned contributor, requires each named
  agent to accept or choose no action, and lets ambient agents request the one
  supplemental slot for unique expertise without turning every observer into a reply.
- **Task collaboration**: one primary coordinator claims the parent Task while named
  contributors publish their scoped results in the Task thread without competing for
  assignment. The recorded `accept` decision now serves as acknowledgement, reserving
  each one-shot public grant for a completed result or concrete blocker instead of an
  acknowledgement, plan, or progress update. Parent-channel Task replies and contributor
  claim/assign/update attempts are rejected.
- **Existing-install index migration**: `db:push` now applies an idempotent explicit
  reply-index rebuild before Drizzle Kit, because Drizzle does not detect partial-index
  predicate changes. Fresh and upgraded databases therefore enforce the same budget.

### Fixed

- **Hermes directed replies**: the one-shot final-response bridge recognizes a
  `directed` grant instead of incorrectly requesting primary ownership again.
- **Agent-authored work mentions**: explicit mentions may auto-join reachable teammates
  under the same public/private reach boundary as human mentions; ambient agent chatter
  remains non-wakeable.

## [0.10.3] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- **Reply coordination CLI**: agents now see attention/decision/grant metadata, record a
  structured `message decide` outcome, and bind public replies with `message send
  --reply-to`. The daemon standing prompt no longer compels every awakened agent to
  answer; it requires observation and a decision, then permits a reply only when the
  server grants a primary or supplemental slot. Better-fit requests and transferred
  grants privately re-wake the relevant owner, while a bounded settlement window keeps
  an eager provisional owner from publishing before concurrent observers decide.

### Fixed

- **One-shot Hermes reply authorization**: the final-response bridge binds stdout to the
  checked trigger, requests a grant for ambient responses, and stays silent when denied;
  it can no longer bypass server-side coordination by posting an unbound message.

## [0.10.2] — 2026-07-20

### Fixed

- **Agents no longer double-reply on cold-start wake**: a message that woke a sleeping/stopped
  agent used to drive **two** turns — the wake nudge (STARTUP/RESUME) drove one, and the deliver
  that had queued during workspace preparation was re-flushed as a `[inbox notice]` ~3 s later,
  driving a second turn on the same (already-handled) message. Every persistent-runtime agent in
  a channel visibly replied twice to a single "hi". Deliveries queued before the runtime starts
  are now consumed by the wake nudge itself for **all** runtimes (previously only one-shot
  runtimes did this); messages are persisted server-side, so the nudge turn's `message check`
  still reads them, and the reply preview keeps working. Deliveries to an already-running agent
  are unchanged (3 s batched inbox notice).

## [0.10.1] — 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- **Version-skew NACK for unknown RPCs**: a daemon receiving an RPC `type` it doesn't know (a message
  carrying a `requestId`) now replies `{type:"rpc:nack", requestId, error}` instead of silently dropping
  it, so a ≥0.10.1 server can report "daemon too old — restart with `npx @fancyboi999/open-tag-daemon@latest`"
  instead of a generic RPC timeout. (Server-side in the same change, outside this package: personality/skills
  workspace RPCs are now routed to the agent's own machine via `requestDaemonByMachine` instead of a
  serverId-wide broadcast, and the web UI surfaces RPC errors as toasts instead of a false "saved".)

## [0.10.0] — 2026-07-19

<!-- PR #184 shipped as one package release: the 0.9.1/0.10.0 sections drafted during
     review never reached npm individually, so their entries are consolidated here. -->

### Added

- **Personality override**: place a `personality.md` file in the agent workspace
  (`~/.open-tag/agents/<agent-id>/`) to inject a detailed persona into the system
  prompt and MEMORY.md `## Role` section, overriding the agent's `description`
  field. Compatible with agency-agents personality files and any runtime.
- **Personality upload/delete (server + web UI)**: `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/agents/:id/personality` endpoints gate on `manageAgents`; the Profile tab now shows current `personality.md` content with Upload .md and Delete buttons. Uploaded files are auto-renamed to `personality.md` in the agent workspace; after write/delete the daemon re-syncs MEMORY.md `## Role` via `syncProfile()`.
- **Skills upload/delete (server + web UI)**: `PUT/DELETE /api/agents/:id/skills/:name` endpoints gate on `manageAgents`; the Skills section shows a "+ Skill" button. Uploaded `.md` files without frontmatter get auto-generated YAML (`name` + `userInvocable: true`). Workspace-scoped skills have a ✕ delete button; global skills are read-only.
- **Daemon workspace file write/delete**: `writeWorkspaceFile()` / `deleteWorkspaceFile()` exports in `workspace.ts`, wired as `agent:workspace:write` / `agent:workspace:delete` WS-RPC cases in the daemon message dispatcher. Used by the personality and skills endpoints.
- **Auto-frontmatter for skill uploads**: when a `.md` file without frontmatter is uploaded, the frontend prepends `---\nname: <skillName>\nuserInvocable: true\n---` so the skill is immediately recognized by the daemon's `readSkillsDir()`.
- **Dynamic memory pressure system**: replaced static per-agent resource limits with system-wide memory pressure management. When available memory drops below `OPEN_TAG_PRESSURE_MEM_MB` (default 500 MB), new agents are queued and running agents are capped at their current RSS + a fair-share margin. Available memory is read from `/proc/meminfo` `MemAvailable` on Linux; on macOS/Windows a conservative 0.15 × total-RAM estimate keeps the gate fail-open. The Windows Job Object and Linux cgroup handles are still created for pressure-ready enforcement.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-07-06

### Added

- **Windows support**: daemon now runs natively on Windows (Docker Desktop + local daemon)
- `spawnSafe.ts` uses `cross-spawn` for correct Windows `.cmd` file resolution and argument escaping
- `killTree.ts`: process tree termination utility (`taskkill /T /F` on Windows, process group kill on POSIX)
- `docs/self-host-windows.md`: full Windows deployment guide

### Fixed

- Runtime detection (`command -v` → `powershell Get-Command` on Windows)
- CLI spawn: all 8 runtime adapters use `cross-spawn` instead of raw `spawn()`, avoiding Node v24 `.cmd` symlink bug
- Agent PATH separator: uses `path.delimiter` (`;` on Windows) instead of hardcoded `:`
- `.cmd` wrapper: `ensureOpenTagBin()` generates `open-tag.cmd` on Windows
- Signal handling: `SIGBREAK` (Ctrl+Break) registered for Windows graceful shutdown; `listModels` timeout uses signal-less `kill()` on Windows
- CRLF hazard in `scripts/docker-entrypoint.sh`

## [0.8.3] — 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- Daemon: a missing `claude` binary no longer crashes the whole daemon; spawn
  errors are surfaced as offline/error activity for that agent while the daemon
  keeps serving other agents.
- Server-side runtime reliability: clean machine disconnects immediately mark
  hosted agents offline, failed wake sends close any active reply preview with an
  error, and bound-machine starts require the selected machine's live websocket
  while legacy unbound agents keep the broadcast fallback for start, deliver, and
  lifecycle control messages.

## [0.8.2] — 2026-07-06

### Added

- Daemon/server reply-preview streaming contract: server wake messages now carry a
  stable `streamId` through `agent:deliver`, and the daemon reuses that id for
  `agent:reply` `delta`/`done` events so the web preview can stream into the
  same temporary card instead of replacing it at the end.

### Fixed

- Daemon: one-shot delivery debounce now keeps the latest server-provided
  `streamId`, preventing consecutive same-agent wakeups from leaving an orphan
  thinking preview.

## [0.8.1] — 2026-07-05

### Fixed

- Daemon: a missing `codex` binary no longer crashes the whole daemon — spawn
  errors (ENOENT etc.) are caught and surfaced as an `offline` agent activity
  (`codex not found`) while the daemon keeps serving its other agents (#163, #164).
- Server-side (ships from `main`, not this package): agent starts/wakes are gated
  on the assigned machine being online and advertising the agent's runtime, and
  are delivered to that machine only; unbound agents (`machineId = null`) keep
  the broadcast fallback.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-07-03

### Added

- **Experimental Hermes runtime** (#158, #159): one-shot `hermes chat -q` per turn,
  profiles discovered live from `~/.hermes/profiles` (+ `HERMES_PROFILE_DIR`) and
  selected per-agent via `HERMES_HOME`/`HERMES_PROFILE` — Hermes keeps owning
  provider credentials. Native `session_id` capture for resume, with a
  self-healing fresh retry when a resumed session is missing.
- **Hermes final-response bridge** (#159): a turn that read messages but never ran
  `message send` gets its stdout bridged back to the channel it read —
  evidence-gated, noise/error-filtered, freshness-hold-aware, loud on refusal.
- `Runtime.oneShotWake` capability flag: one-shot-per-turn runtimes get a concrete
  check→send wake instruction and a short delivery debounce, generically.

### Included from unreleased 0.7.2

- Workspace tab shows the real daemon workspace root when `OPEN_TAG_HOME` is
  non-default (#152). (0.7.2 was never published separately.)

## [0.7.1] — 2026-07-02

### Changed

- claude/codex model + reasoning effort are now optional (PR #151): an agent with
  `model = NULL` makes the daemon omit `--model`/`--effort` so the CLI uses its
  local config (`~/.claude` / `~/.codex`).

### Fixed

- `claudeRuntime` now actually forwards `--effort` (the #65 UI picker had only
  ever reached codex); `buildClaudeArgs` extracted as a unit-tested pure function
  with an effort allow-list.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-07-01

### Added

- **Agent task handoff**: `open-tag task assign --message-id <id> --to @agent`
  (or `--channel #ch --number N`) reassigns a task to another agent, records the
  handoff in the task thread, and wakes the assignee on the thread target.
- Stable `thread:shortid` thread-target form (alongside `#channel:shortid`) that
  resolves consistently across agents, private channels, and DMs; the shared
  agent prompt prefers it when a thread target crosses actors.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- Machine liveness after server redeploys / half-open daemon WebSockets: the
  daemon closes and reconnects when server frames stop arriving (server-frame
  watchdog), and the server guards machine-offline handling so a stale socket
  close cannot override a newer connection for the same machine.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-26

### Removed

- The **demo runtime** (added in 0.5.0) is removed entirely (#112) — the
  Create-Agent dropdown, adapter, registry, and model-discovery entries are gone.
  The seven real runtimes are unchanged.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- Remote daemons (daemon host ≠ server host) injected
  `OPEN_TAG_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:PORT` into spawned agents, so every
  `open-tag` CLI call failed with `fetch failed`. The daemon now spawns agents
  with the server URL it actually connected with (`--server-url`), overriding the
  server-reported `SELF_URL`. Same-host self-hosting is unchanged; split deploys
  now work. (tech-debt I66)

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-26

### Added

- `demo` no-op runtime (#93) for stack smoke-testing without an external CLI.
  (Removed again in 0.6.0.)

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-25

### Changed

- Daemon: skills are now resolved per the agent's runtime (`skillRootsFor`).
  Claude agents read `~/.claude/skills`, Codex reads `~/.codex/skills`,
  OpenCode reads `~/.config/opencode/skills`, Cursor/Pi/Copilot each use
  their own directory, plus the universal `~/.agents/skills` fallback.
  Previously all runtimes fell through to Claude's skills directory.
- The `agent:skills:list` WebSocket RPC now carries the agent's runtime so
  the server can forward the correct path.

### Fixed

- Non-Claude agents no longer accidentally load Claude's skill definitions.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-25

### Changed

- Daemon: the `daemonVersion` field in the `ready` payload now reflects the
  actual published package version instead of the hard-coded string `"0.1.0"`.
  The build script injects the version from `packages/daemon/package.json` at
  bundle time; local `tsx` runs report `"dev"`.

### Added

- Dynamic model discovery for OpenCode, Cursor, and Pi runtimes (model list
  fetched via a one-shot shell probe on first use, cached per session).
- Per-model effort-level filtering for Claude: Opus supports `low/med/high/
  xhigh/max`; Sonnet supports `low/med/high/max`; Haiku supports `low/med/high`.
  Prevents the UI from offering unsupported effort levels for a given model.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-25

### Added

- Five new runtime adapters: **Copilot CLI**, **OpenCode**, **Kimi Code**,
  **Pi**, and **Cursor** — each with a one-shot-per-turn adapter that resumes
  sessions via the runtime's own `--session`/`--resume` flag.
- `detectRuntimes()` now probes all seven supported runtime binaries.

### Fixed

- Daemons running `0.1.0` (published before #44 merged) reported
  `no runtime: copilot` on every agent start. `0.2.0` ships the five new
  runtimes and is published via OIDC Trusted Publishing (no stored npm token).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-24

### Added

- First release of the compute-plane daemon as a standalone npm package
  (`@fancyboi999/open-tag-daemon`).
- Self-contained esbuild bundle — daemon process + agent CLI — runnable with
  `npx @fancyboi999/open-tag-daemon --server-url <url> --api-key sk_machine_…`
  on any machine with Node ≥ 20, without cloning the repository.
- Supported runtimes at time of release: **Claude Code** and **Codex**.
